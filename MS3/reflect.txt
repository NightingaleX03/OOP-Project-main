During this Project, I've learned about various concepts but most importantly how much hard work I need to put into understanding the problem prior to
coding the solution out right away. I've taken so long to submit this project because of how long it's been taking me to code the project out. Overall I'm thankful to have 
completed the solution on time despite only being able to recieving 10%.
